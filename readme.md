## ⚙️ Asynchronous JavaScript – _Star Wars API Fetcher_

This project was focused on practicing **asynchronous JavaScript** and working with external APIs. The app dynamically retrieves data based on the selected category and displays it in the browser without navigating away from the current page.

---

## 🧠 Objective

To build an app that:

- Fetches and displays Star Wars data using the **[SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/)** or a similar API.
- Dynamically updates the page content based on category selection.
- Stays on a **single HTML file** (no page reloads or new file loads).

---

## 📁 Project Requirements

✅ The application must:

- Retrieve and display **4 different categories** of Star Wars data.
- Load and render data **dynamically** on the same page when users select a category.
- Display a **minimum of 6 records** for each category.
- Ensure each record shows at least:
  - 5 different properties
  - 1 image that represents the entity or object
